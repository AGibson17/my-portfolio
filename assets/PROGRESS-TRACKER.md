## 📋 To Do Next

### Hero Section

### Case Study Pages
**Decision:** Going with separate HTML pages (cleaner, better SEO)

#### Structure to Build:
```
case-studies/
├── customer-service-training.html
├── digital-handbook.html
├── managing-conflict.html
├── difficult-conversations.html
└── pc-troubleshooting.html
```

#### Each Case Study Needs:
1. Hero section (project title, quick stats)
2. Overview (problem, solution, role)
3. Process (methodology, approach)
4. Visuals (screenshots, mockups)
5. Results (metrics, outcomes)
6. Key learnings
7. Navigation (back to portfolio, next project)

### Final Polish
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Update contact email/LinkedIn/resume links
- [ ] Optimize all images (TinyPNG, etc.)
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers
- [ ] Test on real mobile devices
- [ ] Run WAVE accessibility checker
- [ ] Check all links work
- [ ] Proofread all content

### Optional Enhancements

## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions Made:
- **Grid layout**: 2x2 for 4 cards (balanced, clean)
- **FAB style**: Gradient with rotation (matches theme)
- **Alpha aesthetic**: Future tech with purple/cyan (distinct from professional work)
- **Button gradients**: Subtle but present (LaCroix vibes ✨)
- **Volcano instructions**: Cyan accent callout (helpful without overwhelming)

### What's Working Well:
- Visual hierarchy is clear
- Sections feel distinct but cohesive
- Animations are smooth and performant
- Dark theme maintains readability
- Alpha section feels innovative

### Still Need Feedback On:
- Hero section design (waiting on visual)
- Case study content depth
- Overall flow and narrative
