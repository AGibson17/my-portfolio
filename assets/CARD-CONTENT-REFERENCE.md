## 📝 Tips for Writing Your Back Content:

### Stats:
- **Pick what matters most** - Don't force 4 stats if you only have 3 good ones
- **Use real numbers** when you have them (+29%, 500+, etc.)
- **Qualitative is fine** when quantitative isn't available (High, Strong, Multiple)
- **Keep it scannable** - Short labels, clear values

### Summary:
- **2-3 sentences max** - This is a preview, not the full story
- **Focus on what, not how** - Save methodology for case study
- **Highlight impact** - What changed? What improved?
- **Make it compelling** - This should make them want to click

### General:
- **Front = Hook** - Catch their eye
- **Back = Tease** - Give them a taste
- **Case Study = Deep Dive** - Tell the full story
